# Drawing Exercise

### Running the application

You can simply run the application by double clicking the **index.html** file or opening it using a browser ( Google Chrome )

### Description

This application is created using HTML 5 Canvas to simulate different objects like lines, rectangles and bucket fills.

### Canvas properties

You can set the width and height of the canvas example:

Max **width** is **700** , Max **height** is **300**

**width** = 700 , **height** = 300


### Canvas Shapes

For the canvas shapes you can use the select option between **L** = Line or **R** = Rectangle


#### Line example:

x1 = 10 , y1 = 20 , x2 = 60 , y2 = 20


#### Rectangle example:

x1 = 10 , y1 = 50 , x2 = 60 , y2 = 20


### Canvas Fill

This works like a bucket fill in Paint. **B** = Bucket Fill

#### Fill example:

x1 = 0 , y1 = 0 , Color = Red
